this is for time & space complexity for recurssion
so on'

=>factorial ->>
    recurssion relation
    f(n) = n*(f(n-1))
    T(n) = k1 + k2 + t(n-1)
    t(0) = k1
    t(n) = n*k + k1;
    #time  complexity of factorial is = O(n)
    #space complexity of factorial is = O(n)

=> Binary Search->>
    #time complexity of Binary Search is = O(logn)
    #space complexity of Binary Search is = O(logn)
=> Merge Sort->>
    #time complexity of Merge Sort is = O(nlogn)
    #space complexity of Merge Sort is = O(n)
=> Fibonacci Series->>
    #time complexity of Fibonacci Search = O(n,powerof(2)) =2n
    #space complexity of Fibonacci Search = O(n)
