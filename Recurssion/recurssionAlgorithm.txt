recurssion is algorithm where a function callin g to itself

********************************Like This function
fn(n){
    fn(n);
}
********************************
but if it will work like thi sthen it will stuck in the infinite loop

so we have some parts in the recuression function, from that we can stop it
1.base case // it will help as to stop the recurssion
2.small calculation  //it will help to handle the logic
3.recurssive formula // it will help us to use recurssive approach insid ethe fucntion

********************************
second and third we wil change to our requirements
