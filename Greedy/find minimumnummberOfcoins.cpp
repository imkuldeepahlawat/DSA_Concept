// Find minimum number of coins

// Problem Statement: Given a value V, if we want to make a change for V Rs, and we have an infinite supply of each of the denominations in Indian currency, i.e., we have an infinite supply of { 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000} valued coins/notes, what is the minimum number of coins and/or notes needed to make the change.

/**
 * int V = 49;
  vector < int > ans;
  int coins[] = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000};
  int n = 9;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    while (V >= coins[i]) {
      V -= coins[i];
      ans.push_back(coins[i]);
    }
  }
